This is a template to help you get started with the team's GitHub Report. Use this template to help guide your team on getting started.

You will need to add additional files per team assignment.

## Tips if the template does not initially publish correctly:
If, after you have checked these settings (https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/fork-report-website/#settings-to-check), often renaming the workflow file will initiate builds (for whatever reason).

Either on your computer or on the GitHub website,
1. Navigate to the files of your repository in the .github/workflows/.
1. Rename **pages.yml** to something else (**main.yml** worked for me).
1 Stage, commit, and push your files.
1. Check the "actions" tab (found in your repository's main GitHub page) to see that your commit is triggering the **"mkdocs-build"** action.

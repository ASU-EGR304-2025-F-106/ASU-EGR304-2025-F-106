<td>"I purchased this hydroponic growing system, and I am thoroughly impressed with its performance. The system is easy to set up, even for beginners. What really stands out is how quickly my plants started growing. Within just a few weeks, I noticed vibrant, healthy leaves and strong stems. The system circulates water efficiently, which prevents the risk of over-watering and ensures that the plants are getting a consistent supply of nutrients. The environment for plant growth is incredibly controlled, which means I can grow crops all year round, regardless of outdoor weather conditions. There's minimal maintenance required once it's set up, and I haven't had to deal with pests or weeds, making the process hassle-free. Overall, I highly recommend this hydroponic system for anyone looking to grow healthy, vibrant plants."</td>

<td>"We love this unit but the pump motors keep failing. We have replaced this product twice now through Amazon and now our most recent  replacement is having the same issues. It starts out great right out of the box. We followed the instructions and started growing our own cilantro, parsley, basil, and oregano right away. The produce tastes so amazing that we ended up getting a second unit hoping we would no longer have to buy the items we grow from the grocery store. During weeks 3-4 the pump motors keep failing. They will start off silent but then after about the third week you will start having a noticeable buzzing noise. We have tried everything from trimming the root systems down and also removing the pump and thoroughly cleaning it. Nothing works. It ends up getting so loud that it is unbearable. If they could fix this issue I would give this product 5 stars. Being that I have already replaced two and the third one is now doing the same thing there is definitely a quality issue. For now I will keep replacing them through Amazon as long as they let me. But maybe a pricier unit from another brand might be in store for us down the road."</td>

<td>"I am so impressed with this 4-in-1 soil moisture meter! As someone who loves gardening and taking care of indoor plants, this tool has been a total game changer. It’s so easy to use and gives me accurate readings for soil moisture, pH level, sunlight, and temperature — all in one device! Now I finally know exactly when to water and where to place my plants for the best light. The digital screen is clear and easy to read, and I love that it helps me avoid overwatering or underwatering my plants. It’s lightweight, durable, and doesn’t disturb the roots when testing. Since using this meter, my plants have been healthier and happier than ever. If you love your plants and want to make plant care so much easier, this is definitely worth it. Highly recommend!"</td>

<td>"Cons: - for successful planning of a garden and house plant maintenance, you need to know how many hours of sunlight the plants will get, not just how intense the light is in one single moment in which you take the measurement. This instrument does not provide this information at all (and it's what I needed the most, and what other reviews don't make clear). It would be much improved if it could be left in a spot for few hours to measure the hours of sunlight exposure. Otherwise, the measure of intensity of light is useless for outdoor gardens (without knowing how many hours of that sun the plants will get). Indoor you might need to measure that, but outdoor it's pretty simple (sun intensity varies by season, and sun intensity doesn't measure the hours of sun exposure) - if your PH is fine (neutral, which most plants seem to prefer), you won't need this functionality a lot. You would only need to recheck the soil PH if you actually needed to modify it. Otherwise, if you're using it in your own yard, soil PH has a tendency to stay the same over time (unless of course you are treating the soil to make it more alkaline or acidic) - so the only useful functionality is the measure of moisture (indoor and outdoor use) and temperature (for outdoor plants). - three stars is for not giving the full picture on sun exposure. Plants need water, sun, and quality soil to thrive. Adequate hours of sun, in my experience, make or break the outdoor garden. So it's a crucial piece of information that you won't get from this tool, and you will need to purchase another tool to obtain."</td>

I checked the readings against results of soil from the same location/depth with the results of a LaMotte and Rapidtest soil test kits. Not even close. It wanted me to believe that a soil which measured around 7.5 was actually acidic, around 4.5. Enough of that, time to return. Please don't expect any different results.

It has a clear, easy-to-read display, and the results are quite accurate. It's lightweight, durable, and works immediately without any fuss.

<td>“I am so disappointed that this product did not work for me. All the reviews that I had read prior to the purchase had been very good. One day after I had installed the system, I removed the stakes from my plants to test it and to attempt to determine how much water was being distributed to each plant. However, after removing the stakes, 4 of the 7 stakes I used continued to drip although the system had been turned off. I put the 4 dripping stakes in a large pot to allow any potential residual water in the tubing time to empty. 4 hours later, the pot was 2/3 full and each stake continued to drip at a rate of about two drops per second. The only way I could stop the dripping was to disconnect the power and remove the filter from the water source. I contacted the product customer service. Although she was very nice and did confirm that there was residual water in the tubing, she could offer no additional suggestions. I am returning the system.”</td>

<p>Description:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accurate Soil Moisture Detection：The XLUX Soil Moisture Meter can tell you if the 
soil deep inside your pot or garden is dry, moist or wet; whereas your eyes and fingers 
can only determine the moisture level of the soil surface.
-Easy-to-Read Large Dial: The large dial is easy to read and includes three zones with 
ten scales, making it very straightforward to understand.
-Immediate Moisture Reading: Insert the probe into the soil, and without waiting, the 
dial will immediately display the moisture level. You can then decide whether your plant 
needs watering based on the measurement. Do not leave this moisture meter in the soil for
 more than 5 minutes, as the metal tip will gradually corrode.
-Less Damage: A single probe causes less damage to plant roots compared to double or 
multiple probes, and when you remove the probe after testing, it won't bring out much soil.
-Usage Precautions: Do not use it to test very hard soil. Do not test water or other liquids. 
After testing, please wipe the probe clean.</li>

BUT the one thing that should be emphasized is that you need to follow the directions about NOT using it on very dry soil, rocky soil etc, which are very clearly detailed in the handy little KLUX Instructions booklet that come with it. Also you need to wipe it off from soil or dirt as the manufacturer recommends. If not, it will eventually stop working and read "DRY" when it is not! As a result you may find yourself (like I did) ordering a new one every few years because it has stopped working! Meanwhile, f you just gently use fine sandpaper on the tip to clean off the natural oxidation that occurs, it works like new!”</td>

<td>“Stay Away!! This is a scam!! This product worked pretty well for about three weeks and then just stopped working altogether. They will not allow you to return it after 30 days. I was just past this time period. I only used it for interior plants, so it was treated very gently, and I never left it sitting in soil for a long time. I always cleaned it with a damp paper towel (between plant readings), so that I am not passing the soil from one plant to another. I had to call Amazon and sit on the phone for 20 minutes to get a return because they will not let you return it after 30 days, but it stopped working after 30 days, so you're just kind of stuck. Stay away and go buy a different product. I did not ask for a replacement. I will just be purchasing a different product. Buyer beware.”</td>

I would skip a day after watering, and would get a dry reading. So I would water them. Now my tomato plants have root rot. I thought it was do to all the rain we were having. So I moved the plants on to the porch. The other day I could not find the meter and went and bought one in town. The new meter showed wet. Using the past readings from this meter I thought they would need watered. Now I will be lucky if my tomato plants survive. Today I put the meter in water and it said dry.

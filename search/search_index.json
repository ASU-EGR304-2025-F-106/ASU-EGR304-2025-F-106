The system is easy to set up, even for beginners. What really stands out is how quickly my plants started growing. Within just a few weeks, I noticed vibrant, healthy leaves and strong stems. The system circulates water efficiently, which prevents the risk of over-watering and ensures that the plants are getting a consistent supply of nutrients. The environment for plant growth is incredibly controlled, which means I can grow crops all year round, regardless of outdoor weather conditions. There's minimal maintenance required once it's set up, and I haven't had to deal with pests or weeds, making the process hassle-free. Overall, I highly recommend this hydroponic system for anyone looking to grow healthy, vibrant plants.\" 1. The system is effective showing tangible results in plant growth  (explicit) I purchased this to replace another Aero garden when its pump failed. This system comes with everything you need to grow an indoor herb garden, except for the seeds, but by purchasing the seeds separately you can ensure their freshness. My herbs sprouted within a week and are growing beautifully. This system comes with eight slots for plants, but herbs can grow very lush and I only planted five. Also, the light telescopes to a higher height than my previous system, allowing the plants to grow higher. Overall, a very good purchase! 2. The system has minimal upkeep (explicit) This hydroponics planter works, my wife planted during the cold season and she harvested 90 days later indoors all we planted was cilantro and it worked, lights are bright and on a timer so the only thing to watch is the water level the rest is automatically done 3. The system is not affected by external variables like weather  (latent) <p>NEGATIVE COMMENTS</p> Voice of the customer Restated Customer Need \"We love this unit but the pump motors keep failing. We have replaced this product twice now through Amazon and now our most recent  replacement is having the same issues. It starts out great right out of the box. We followed the instructions and started growing our own cilantro, parsley, basil, and oregano right away. The produce tastes so amazing that we ended up getting a second unit hoping we would no longer have to buy the items we grow from the grocery store. During weeks 3-4 the pump motors keep failing. They will start off silent but then after about the third week you will start having a noticeable buzzing noise. We have tried everything from trimming the root systems down and also removing the pump and thoroughly cleaning it. Nothing works. It ends up getting so loud that it is unbearable. If they could fix this issue I would give this product 5 stars. Being that I have already replaced two and the third one is now doing the same thing there is definitely a quality issue. For now I will keep replacing them through Amazon as long as they let me. But maybe a pricier unit from another brand might be in store for us down the road.\" 1. The systems components must be able to last a long duration and can be easily replaced if needed (explicit) DO NOT PURCHASE. Mid May 2025, I purchased this unit. Upon filling with water, there was a design flaw with the drain plug and water drained all over my table and floor. I contacted the seller and received a replacement unit and was told to go ahead and keep the defective. Good customer service. I sealed off the bad drain plug and used the first unit. A week later the motor began to make a horrible buzzing noise. But since this was the gimme unit, I didn't report anything. The replacement was received quickly and set up right at the end of May or early June. All was good with the unit until this morning, July 22. It lasted about 6-7 weeks but now the motor on the replacement is making the same horrible buzzing. 2 units, 2 failures. It is a shame, because I really like the size and the fact you can remove the lighting panel - which makes cleaning the reservoir so easy. I was about to buy another, but glad I hadn't made the purchase yet. 2. The system must have a minimal footprint not taking up too much space and not making excessive noise (explicit) This hydroponics growing system is trash. Be aware you can NOT return. I tired to use this just under a month. I used very viable lettuce seeds that grow well in my other hydroponics and in ground but not in this hydroponics system. I thought to to check it out and discovered both motors are not working. I pushed the button for them to turn on. It runs but makes a weird noise then stops. No water flow, nothing. I tried to return it and they will not let me even though its been under a month. 3.

The user needs a way to reduce overthinking about plant care (explicit) <p>NEGATIVE COMMENTS</p> Voice of the customer Restated Customer Need \"Cons: - for successful planning of a garden and house plant maintenance, you need to know how many hours of sunlight the plants will get, not just how intense the light is in one single moment in which you take the measurement. This instrument does not provide this information at all (and it's what I needed the most, and what other reviews don't make clear). It would be much improved if it could be left in a spot for few hours to measure the hours of sunlight exposure. Otherwise, the measure of intensity of light is useless for outdoor gardens (without knowing how many hours of that sun the plants will get). Indoor you might need to measure that, but outdoor it's pretty simple (sun intensity varies by season, and sun intensity doesn't measure the hours of sun exposure) - if your PH is fine (neutral, which most plants seem to prefer), you won't need this functionality a lot. You would only need to recheck the soil PH if you actually needed to modify it. Otherwise, if you're using it in your own yard, soil PH has a tendency to stay the same over time (unless of course you are treating the soil to make it more alkaline or acidic) - so the only useful functionality is the measure of moisture (indoor and outdoor use) and temperature (for outdoor plants). - three stars is for not giving the full picture on sun exposure. Plants need water, sun, and quality soil to thrive. Adequate hours of sun, in my experience, make or break the outdoor garden. So it's a crucial piece of information that you won't get from this tool, and you will need to purchase another tool to obtain.\" 1.

If you plan on using this to monitor or even spot-check ph, don't. From the start I noticed that ph readings varied signficantly with the dept of the probe into the soil, from 5.5 down to 3.5. Then it tried to tell me that wood ash is acidic. I checked the readings against results of soil from the same location/depth with the results of a LaMotte and Rapidtest soil test kits. Not even close. It wanted me to believe that a soil which measured around 7.5 was actually acidic, around 4.5. Enough of that, time to return. Please don't expect any different results.

All the reviews that I had read prior to the purchase had been very good. One day after I had installed the system, I removed the stakes from my plants to test it and to attempt to determine how much water was being distributed to each plant. However, after removing the stakes, 4 of the 7 stakes I used continued to drip although the system had been turned off. I put the 4 dripping stakes in a large pot to allow any potential residual water in the tubing time to empty. 4 hours later, the pot was 2/3 full and each stake continued to drip at a rate of about two drops per second. The only way I could stop the dripping was to disconnect the power and remove the filter from the water source. I contacted the product customer service.

BUT the one thing that should be emphasized is that you need to follow the directions about NOT using it on very dry soil, rocky soil etc, which are very clearly detailed in the handy little KLUX Instructions booklet that come with it. Also you need to wipe it off from soil or dirt as the manufacturer recommends. If not, it will eventually stop working and read \"DRY\" when it is not!

This is a scam!! This product worked pretty well for about three weeks and then just stopped working altogether. They will not allow you to return it after 30 days. I was just past this time period. I only used it for interior plants, so it was treated very gently, and I never left it sitting in soil for a long time. I always cleaned it with a damp paper towel (between plant readings), so that I am not passing the soil from one plant to another. I had to call Amazon and sit on the phone for 20 minutes to get a return because they will not let you return it after 30 days, but it stopped working after 30 days, so you're just kind of stuck.

Buyer beware.\u201d Reliable for extended periods of time (latent) Fulfills roles advertised to the end-user (explicit) \u201cI bought this for 2 house plants and I started using it for my 2 potted tomato plants outside. The tomato plants have very good soil drainage. I would skip a day after watering, and would get a dry reading. So I would water them. Now my tomato plants have root rot. I thought it was do to all the rain we were having. So I moved the plants on to the porch. The other day I could not find the meter and went and bought one in town. The new meter showed wet. Using the past readings from this meter I thought they would need watered. Now I will be lucky if my tomato plants survive. Today I put the meter in water and it said dry. I used the new meter and it said Wet+. Tossing the meter I bought here.\u201d Reliable for extended periods of time (latent) Fulfills roles advertised to the end-user (explicit) \u201cThis is a moisture meter that does not measure moisture. After a few months of use, it registers all plants as 'dry', regardless of their moisture level. All plants measure the same moisture level. Even on a plant that has been submerged in water for 24 hours, it says it is at the lowest possible moisture reading. Even when submerged in water, it says it is bone dry. You might as well use a chopstick to take a reading as you will get the same utility out of it.\u201d Reliable for extended periods of time (latent) Fulfills roles advertised to the end-user (explicit)","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"03-User-Needs-and%20Benchmarking/#100-grouped-needs-sorted-by-importance-of-group","title":"100 Grouped Needs Sorted by Importance of Group","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Ease of Use (15 needs) Meta Need: The user needs a seamless and intuitive experience </p> <ul> <li>Easy to set up out of the box.</li> <li>Clear instructions without technical jargon.</li> <li>Simple calibration process.</li> <li>Mobile app with intuitive interface.</li> <li>Multilingual support in the app and device.</li> <li>Plug-and-play installation (no special tools).</li> <li>Clear visual indicators (e.g., LEDs).</li> <li>Automatic firmware updates.</li> <li>Ability to share access with family/housemates.</li> <li>Voice assistant integration (Alexa, Google).</li> <li>Guided onboarding within the app.</li> <li>Customizable notification preferences.</li> <li>Quick troubleshooting guide.</li> <li>Battery replacement or charging instructions are obvious.</li> <li>Universal soil probe size (fits most pots).</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Functionality (25 needs) Meta Need: The product will provide critical information</p> <ul> <li>Accurate soil moisture measurement.</li> <li>Detects under-watering.</li> <li>Detects over-watering.</li> <li>Measures ambient light levels.</li> <li>Tracks light exposure duration.</li> <li>Measures soil temperature.</li> <li>Measures air temperature.</li> <li>Detects soil fertility/EC levels.</li> <li>Records historical trends over time.</li> <li>Provides actionable insights (e.g., \u201cWater in 2 days\u201d).</li> <li>Integrates with irrigation systems.</li> <li>Multi-plant support within one app.</li> <li>Alerts for extreme conditions (frost, heatwave).</li> <li>Seasonal growing advice.</li> <li>Growth stage\u2013specific recommendations.</li> <li>Personalized plant care tips based on species.</li> <li>Sensor accuracy in different soil types.</li> <li>Works for indoor and outdoor use.</li> <li>Syncs with grow lights.</li> <li>Alerts for sudden condition changes.</li> <li>Cross-checks data with local weather info.</li> <li>Automatic adjustment of thresholds by plant type.</li> <li>Smart reminders (fertilizer, repotting).</li> <li>Works even in low-connectivity environments.</li> <li>Detects when the sensor is removed from soil.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Safety &amp;

The plant sensor system helps to educate her children to see when the soil is too dry or when the plants need more sunlight through simple icons and lights. The kids enjoy checking the readings and even press the button to trigger watering to see how it works. For Linda, this turns gardening into a family activity while also ensuring the plants stay healthy. Her favorite thing is teaching her kids how to take care of a living thing.</p> <p>User Story #2: Maria</p> <p>Maria is a 27-year-old college student living in Arizona. The hot and dry climate makes it difficult for her to keep her indoor plants healthy. She forgets to water them sometimes and it can be hard to tell if she is overwatering or underwatering. With the plant sensor device, Maria can easily monitor soil moisture, temperature, and light. When her plants are getting dry, the system not only alerts her but can also trigger a small watering function automatically. This gives Maria peace of mind, helps her plants thrive, and saves water in the process by not overwatering.</p> <p>User Story #3: Frank</p> <p>Frank is a 71-year-old who enjoys tending to his backyard garden. However, the physiucal aspects of checking the soil or remembering watering schedules has become difficult for him. With the plant sensor device, Frank can see clear, easy-to-read measurements on the device and usability. The system not only reminds him when watering is needed but can also water the plants automatically.

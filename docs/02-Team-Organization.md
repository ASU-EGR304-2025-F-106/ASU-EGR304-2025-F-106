## Team Charter

> As a team, we will focus on making clear communication, fair tasks and designing practical yet effective embedded system designs. It is important to be efficient, and support each team member when needed. This will be held by meeting project deadlines on time, and using this project to build our skills for real world application.

## Product Mission Statement

> Knowing that Team 106 will present their system during an extremely important event,the Innovation Showcase, we are committed to ensuring that this product demonstrates both the effectiveness of the team and the excellence of the ASU engineering program. The design will reflect not only the technical skills we have developed but also the professionalism and teamwork that define our group. Drawing on the principles learned throughout the course, our product will be crafted to impress both University faculty and industry professionals.

## Team Charter

From the team's set goals, which can be reviewed in ["Appendix: Team Organization"](https://asu-egr304-2025-f-106.github.io/ASU-EGR304-2025-F-106/Appendix/App-Team-Org/), the team's charter formed to be:

> As a team, we will focus on making clear communication, fair tasks and designing practical yet effective embedded system designs. It is important to be efficient, and support each team member when needed. This will be held by meeting project deadlines on time, and using this project to build our skills for real world application.

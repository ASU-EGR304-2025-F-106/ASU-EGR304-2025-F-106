## Team Charter

From the team's set goals, which can be reviewed in ["Appendix: Team Organization"](https://asu-egr304-2025-f-106.github.io/ASU-EGR304-2025-F-106/Appendix/App-Team-Org/), the team's charter formed to be:

> "As a team, we will focus on making clear communication, fair tasks and designing practical yet effective embedded system designs. It is important to be efficient, and support each team member when needed. This will be held by meeting project deadlines on time, and using this project to build our skills for real world application."

## Product Mission Statement

> "Team 106â€™s mission is to design and develop a smart plant system that integrates multiple sensors and actuators to monitor and sustain healthy plant growth automatically. Our goal is to deliver a reliable, well-engineered product that highlights our teamwork, technical skill, and commitment to excellence within the ASU engineering program."

| "I purchased this hydroponic growing system, and I am thoroughly impressed with its performance. The system is easy to set up, even for beginners. What really stands out is how quickly my plants started growing. Within just a few weeks, I noticed vibrant, healthy leaves and strong stems. The system circulates water efficiently, which prevents the risk of over-watering and ensures that the plants are getting a consistent supply of nutrients. The environment for plant growth is incredibly controlled, which means I can grow crops all year round, regardless of outdoor weather conditions. There's minimal maintenance required once it's set up, and I haven't had to deal with pests or weeds, making the process hassle-free. Overall, I highly recommend this hydroponic system for anyone looking to grow healthy, vibrant plants." | 1. The system is effective showing tangible results in plant growth  (explicit) |

| "We love this unit but the pump motors keep failing. We have replaced this product twice now through Amazon and now our most recent  replacement is having the same issues. It starts out great right out of the box. We followed the instructions and started growing our own cilantro, parsley, basil, and oregano right away. The produce tastes so amazing that we ended up getting a second unit hoping we would no longer have to buy the items we grow from the grocery store. During weeks 3-4 the pump motors keep failing. They will start off silent but then after about the third week you will start having a noticeable buzzing noise. We have tried everything from trimming the root systems down and also removing the pump and thoroughly cleaning it. Nothing works. It ends up getting so loud that it is unbearable. If they could fix this issue I would give this product 5 stars. Being that I have already replaced two and the third one is now doing the same thing there is definitely a quality issue. For now I will keep replacing them through Amazon as long as they let me. But maybe a pricier unit from another brand might be in store for us down the road." | 1.

| "I am so impressed with this 4-in-1 soil moisture meter! As someone who loves gardening and taking care of indoor plants, this tool has been a total game changer. It’s so easy to use and gives me accurate readings for soil moisture, pH level, sunlight, and temperature — all in one device! Now I finally know exactly when to water and where to place my plants for the best light. The digital screen is clear and easy to read, and I love that it helps me avoid overwatering or underwatering my plants. It’s lightweight, durable, and doesn’t disturb the roots when testing. Since using this meter, my plants have been healthier and happier than ever. If you love your plants and want to make plant care so much easier, this is definitely worth it. Highly recommend!" | 1.

| "Cons: - for successful planning of a garden and house plant maintenance, you need to know how many hours of sunlight the plants will get, not just how intense the light is in one single moment in which you take the measurement. This instrument does not provide this information at all (and it's what I needed the most, and what other reviews don't make clear). It would be much improved if it could be left in a spot for few hours to measure the hours of sunlight exposure. Otherwise, the measure of intensity of light is useless for outdoor gardens (without knowing how many hours of that sun the plants will get). Indoor you might need to measure that, but outdoor it's pretty simple (sun intensity varies by season, and sun intensity doesn't measure the hours of sun exposure) - if your PH is fine (neutral, which most plants seem to prefer), you won't need this functionality a lot. You would only need to recheck the soil PH if you actually needed to modify it. Otherwise, if you're using it in your own yard, soil PH has a tendency to stay the same over time (unless of course you are treating the soil to make it more alkaline or acidic) - so the only useful functionality is the measure of moisture (indoor and outdoor use) and temperature (for outdoor plants). - three stars is for not giving the full picture on sun exposure. Plants need water, sun, and quality soil to thrive. Adequate hours of sun, in my experience, make or break the outdoor garden. So it's a crucial piece of information that you won't get from this tool, and you will need to purchase another tool to obtain." | 1.

The product is also not intended to register lux intensity from artificial lighting, but rather only from sunlight. This is not indicated in the sale’s information but clearly stated in the user manual." | 1. The user needs a tool that measures light intensity from artificial and natural light (explicit) |

| "A Rip-Off. It will tell you if the soil is wet or dry... more or less. If you plan on using this to monitor or even spot-check ph, don't. From the start I noticed that ph readings varied signficantly with the dept of the probe into the soil, from 5.5 down to 3.5. Then it tried to tell me that wood ash is acidic. I checked the readings against results of soil from the same location/depth with the results of a LaMotte and Rapidtest soil test kits. Not even close. It wanted me to believe that a soil which measured around 7.5 was actually acidic, around 4.5. Enough of that, time to return. Please don't expect any different results. I regret that I cannot give this one a 0 for 5 rating." | 1. The user needs a tool that provides precise readings, rather than rough estimates (explicit) |

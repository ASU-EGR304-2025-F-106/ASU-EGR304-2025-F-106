| "I purchased this hydroponic growing system, and I am thoroughly impressed with its performance. The system is easy to set up, even for beginners. What really stands out is how quickly my plants started growing. Within just a few weeks, I noticed vibrant, healthy leaves and strong stems. The system circulates water efficiently, which prevents the risk of over-watering and ensures that the plants are getting a consistent supply of nutrients. The environment for plant growth is incredibly controlled, which means I can grow crops all year round, regardless of outdoor weather conditions. There's minimal maintenance required once it's set up, and I haven't had to deal with pests or weeds, making the process hassle-free. Overall, I highly recommend this hydroponic system for anyone looking to grow healthy, vibrant plants." | 1. The system is effective showing tangible results in plant growth  (explicit) |

| "We love this unit but the pump motors keep failing. We have replaced this product twice now through Amazon and now our most recent  replacement is having the same issues. It starts out great right out of the box. We followed the instructions and started growing our own cilantro, parsley, basil, and oregano right away. The produce tastes so amazing that we ended up getting a second unit hoping we would no longer have to buy the items we grow from the grocery store. During weeks 3-4 the pump motors keep failing. They will start off silent but then after about the third week you will start having a noticeable buzzing noise. We have tried everything from trimming the root systems down and also removing the pump and thoroughly cleaning it. Nothing works. It ends up getting so loud that it is unbearable. If they could fix this issue I would give this product 5 stars. Being that I have already replaced two and the third one is now doing the same thing there is definitely a quality issue. For now I will keep replacing them through Amazon as long as they let me. But maybe a pricier unit from another brand might be in store for us down the road." | 1.

|“I am so disappointed that this product did not work for me. All the reviews that I had read prior to the purchase had been very good. One day after I had installed the system, I removed the stakes from my plants to test it and to attempt to determine how much water was being distributed to each plant. However, after removing the stakes, 4 of the 7 stakes I used continued to drip although the system had been turned off. I put the 4 dripping stakes in a large pot to allow any potential residual water in the tubing time to empty. 4 hours later, the pot was 2/3 full and each stake continued to drip at a rate of about two drops per second. The only way I could stop the dripping was to disconnect the power and remove the filter from the water source. I contacted the product customer service. Although she was very nice and did confirm that there was residual water in the tubing, she could offer no additional suggestions. I am returning the system.”|Reliable for extended periods of time (latent)|

Price: $12.99

Vendor: Amazon

Description:

- Accurate Soil Moisture Detection：The XLUX Soil Moisture Meter can tell you if the 
soil deep inside your pot or garden is dry, moist or wet; whereas your eyes and fingers 
can only determine the moisture level of the soil surface.
-Easy-to-Read Large Dial: The large dial is easy to read and includes three zones with 
ten scales, making it very straightforward to understand.
-Immediate Moisture Reading: Insert the probe into the soil, and without waiting, the 
dial will immediately display the moisture level. You can then decide whether your plant 
needs watering based on the measurement. Do not leave this moisture meter in the soil for
 more than 5 minutes, as the metal tip will gradually corrode.
-Less Damage: A single probe causes less damage to plant roots compared to double or 
multiple probes, and when you remove the probe after testing, it won't bring out much soil.
-Usage Precautions: Do not use it to test very hard soil. Do not test water or other liquids. 
After testing, please wipe the probe clean.

|“This is a great Moisture Meter and I agree with all the positive reviews left on this site. BUT the one thing that should be emphasized is that you need to follow the directions about NOT using it on very dry soil, rocky soil etc, which are very clearly detailed in the handy little KLUX Instructions booklet that come with it. Also you need to wipe it off from soil or dirt as the manufacturer recommends. If not, it will eventually stop working and read "DRY" when it is not! As a result you may find yourself (like I did) ordering a new one every few years because it has stopped working! Meanwhile, f you just gently use fine sandpaper on the tip to clean off the natural oxidation that occurs, it works like new!”|Reliable for extended periods of time (latent)|

|“Stay Away!! This is a scam!! This product worked pretty well for about three weeks and then just stopped working altogether. They will not allow you to return it after 30 days. I was just past this time period. I only used it for interior plants, so it was treated very gently, and I never left it sitting in soil for a long time. I always cleaned it with a damp paper towel (between plant readings), so that I am not passing the soil from one plant to another. I had to call Amazon and sit on the phone for 20 minutes to get a return because they will not let you return it after 30 days, but it stopped working after 30 days, so you're just kind of stuck.

|“I bought this for 2 house plants and I started using it for my 2 potted tomato plants outside. The tomato plants have very good soil drainage. I would skip a day after watering, and would get a dry reading. So I would water them. Now my tomato plants have root rot. I thought it was do to all the rain we were having. So I moved the plants on to the porch. The other day I could not find the meter and went and bought one in town. The new meter showed wet. Using the past readings from this meter I thought they would need watered. Now I will be lucky if my tomato plants survive. Today I put the meter in water and it said dry. I used the new meter and it said Wet+. Tossing the meter I bought here.”|Reliable for extended periods of time (latent)|

|“This is a moisture meter that does not measure moisture. After a few months of use, it registers all plants as 'dry', regardless of their moisture level. All plants measure the same moisture level. Even on a plant that has been submerged in water for 24 hours, it says it is at the lowest possible moisture reading. Even when submerged in water, it says it is bone dry. You might as well use a chopstick to take a reading as you will get the same utility out of it.”|Reliable for extended periods of time (latent)

## Pondus ante Ialysios vultu exasperat loqui sanguine

Iacere non, quis nimbis. Dumque tibi minora clamabat contigit vacant, sepulcro
coniugis quae; mihi! Solent adeste faventibus, perque penates, currere in quater
Odrysius ferro, vota, vero mittat crinibus, quae. Hanc mundi, ipse vultu voce

## Project Objective

This project aims to investigate and develop smart adaptive technologies, an improved user experience, better fit, improved product design, and product customization options for the next-generation AirPods. The target is to maintain global dominance in the wireless earphone market, drive up AirPod sales to 100 million+ units sold with a 60% global market share in 2021 and expand the user base more towards the luxury, professional, and fitness segments. We believe that adding smart interactions and adaptive audio filters alone will already expand our user base by 15%. With the new generation AirPods we aim to match at least the sound quality of our main competitor, the Sony WF-1000XM3, and include Active Noise Canceling that is also featured in Mifo, House of Marley, Bose, and Amazon Echo products. We will also obtain IPX4 sweat-resistant rating equal to Bose, House of Marley, and Amazon Echo earbuds, and aim to extend our range of colors, as seen in Urbanista and Jabraâ€™s lifestyle products.

## Use Cases

**User Story #1: Jenna**
Linda is a 35 year old mother of two who wants to teach her kids about responsibility and caring for plants. The plant sensor system helps to educate her children to see when the soil is too dry or when the plants need more sunlight through simple icons and lights. The kids enjoy checking the readings and even press the button to trigger watering to see how it works. For Linda, this turns gardening into a family activity while also ensuring the plants stay healthy. Her favorite thing is teaching her kids how to take care of a living thing.

**User Story #2: Maria**
Maria is a 27-year-old college student living in Arizona. The hot and dry climate makes it difficult for her to keep her indoor plants healthy. She forgets to water them sometimes and it can be hard to tell if she is overwatering or underwatering. With the plant sensor device, Maria can easily monitor soil moisture, temperature, and light. When her plants are getting dry, the system not only alerts her but can also trigger a small watering function automatically. This gives Maria peace of mind, helps her plants thrive, and saves water in the process by not overwatering.

**User Story #3: Frank**
Frank is a 71-year-old who enjoys tending to his backyard garden. However, the physiucal aspects of checking the soil or remembering watering schedules has become difficult for him. With the plant sensor device, Frank can see clear, easy-to-read measurements on the device and usability. The system not only reminds him when watering is needed but can also water the plants automatically. This allows Frank to keep his garden healthy and enjoy his hobby comfortably, without the physical strain or worry of forgetting.

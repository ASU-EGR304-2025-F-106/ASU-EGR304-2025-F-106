## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to create a smart plant care system that helps people keep their plants healthy with less effort. The device uses sensors to measure soil moisture, temperature, and light. This then provides feedback that can automatically water the plant when needed. This makes it easier for users to avoid either over or under watering while also saving water and adapting to tough climates like in Arizona.

Beyond convenience, the objective is to make plant care more reliable and accessible for different types of users, from students who are just starting out on their own to families with gardens or older adults who want less physical strain. By combining practical features with simple design, the project aims to deliver a low cost, easy to use solution that supports sustainability while keeping plants thriving.

## Stakeholders

- **Target group** Gardeners and planting ethusiasts, either professionally or recreationally of all ages.
- **Target purchaser** Target group profile with focus on individuals in the working class that have no time to tend to plants as they should. New plant hobbiests who are getting into growing plants and enjoy on their free time.
- **Customer service** Prefer easy set up, interface and clear set up instructions. This also includes a product that is durable and easy troubleshooting.
- **Marketing & Sales division** Attend local Home and Garden shows with demonstations and spreading the product by word of mouth. This includes attending local farmers markets with intention of shwoing face to consumers.
- **Retailers** Prefer products that can be durable during transportation use and the ability to be placed both indoor and outdoor in store placement. 
- **Regulatory instances** Device must comply with electronics and consumer product standards (e.g., FCC, RoHS) and possibly water-use efficiency certifications.

## Use Cases

**User Story #1: Jenna**

Linda is a 35 year old mother of two who wants to teach her kids about responsibility and caring for plants. The plant sensor system helps to educate her children to see when the soil is too dry or when the plants need more sunlight through simple icons and lights. The kids enjoy checking the readings and even press the button to trigger watering to see how it works. For Linda, this turns gardening into a family activity while also ensuring the plants stay healthy. Her favorite thing is teaching her kids how to take care of a living thing.

**User Story #2: Maria**

Maria is a 27-year-old college student living in Arizona. The hot and dry climate makes it difficult for her to keep her indoor plants healthy. She forgets to water them sometimes and it can be hard to tell if she is overwatering or underwatering. With the plant sensor device, Maria can easily monitor soil moisture, temperature, and light. When her plants are getting dry, the system not only alerts her but can also trigger a small watering function automatically. This gives Maria peace of mind, helps her plants thrive, and saves water in the process by not overwatering.

**User Story #3: Frank**

Frank is a 71-year-old who enjoys tending to his backyard garden. However, the physiucal aspects of checking the soil or remembering watering schedules has become difficult for him. With the plant sensor device, Frank can see clear, easy-to-read measurements on the device and usability. The system not only reminds him when watering is needed but can also water the plants automatically. This allows Frank to keep his garden healthy and enjoy his hobby comfortably, without the physical strain or worry of forgetting.

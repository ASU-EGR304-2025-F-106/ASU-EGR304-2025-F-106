## Lessons Learned
 
 1. Start on prototyping and building circuit early so that it is easy to troubleshoot once it is time to put the team system together.
 2. Team meetings and communication are important, it can be difficult to understand if a team member needs help or if they are any issues, and is very beneficial since we all rely on one another.
 3. Double check when dealing with sensors with a oscilliscope to deteermine you are doing what you want it to do whether that is buffering or amplifying a signal.
 4. Learn to be flexible and have a back up plan should any issues occur so you are prepared and know that nothing ever really goes right 100 percent of the time.

## Advice to Future Students

 1. Datasheets are importants so be sure to read through each component.
 2. Double check component footprints and measurements to ensure they will fit on your PCB.
 3. In MPLAB X, double check pins and microcontoller data sheet to ensure you are choosing the right pins and that it wont cause issues when generating your code.
 4. Labs are important in understanding functionality and applying to your subsystem design so be present and make sure you learn and not just do to get it over with.
 5. Document as you go and reread through assingments as details are important especialy when designing and makes workload less heavy in the end.

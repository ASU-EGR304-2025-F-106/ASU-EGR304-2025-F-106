## Lessons Learned
 
 - 1. Start on prototyping and building circuit early so that it is easy to troubleshoot once it is time to put the team system together.
- 2. Team meetings and communication are important, it can be difficult to understand if a team member needs help or if they are any issues, and is very beneficial since we all rely on one another.




## Advice to Future Students

- 1. Datasheets are importants so be sure to read through each component.
- 2. Double check component footprints and measurements to ensure they will fit on your PCB.

## Introduction

Our teamâ€™s block diagram shows the overall design of our plant embedded system, which is divided into two sensors (light and soil moisture) and two actuators (a water pump and a grow light). Each part connects through a shared microcontroller interface so the system can monitor conditions and automatically respond. This makes sure the plant receives the right amount of water and light.

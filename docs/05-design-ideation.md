## Intro/Overview

In collaberation with the team, this is the stage where we move from identifying needs and requirements and in turn look to solve a possible solution. In this section, we explore different approaches from brainstorming and consider how user needs can be translated into practical design. The purpose is to explore a limited range of ideas that can later be implimeted and evaluated into our final product. By sharing and generating different designs, ideas and functions, we give our team the best chance of finding an innovative design direction that is not only functional, but easy to use and practical for those who need it.

## Generating Ideas

Below is the product of generated ideas the team has brainstormed based on the user needs we identified in the previous section (Ease of Use, Functionality, Safety & Durability, Reliability & Performance, Sustainability, Connectivity & Integration, Aesthetics & Design, Support & Education, Value & Cost).

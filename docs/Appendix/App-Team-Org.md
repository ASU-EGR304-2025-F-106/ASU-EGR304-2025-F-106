### Main Method for Group Communication

Based on the information provided on in the "Team Member Communication Modes," the group primary method of communication is to communicate through text in the group chat.
 
## Communication Procedures

1. How will your team communicate?

    The team will communicate mostly through our group chat if any issues should occur as well as during our weekly meetings. Email will also be another source of communication.

2. How will you handle instructor correspondence? Who is responsible? How will that be communicated with/back to the group?

    During class we will get together as a group to our instructor, however if out of class the acting team leader will be the main point of contact to the instructor to avoid any confusion. The acting team lead will send and recieve any information provided by the instructor. This will be communicated with the group either in or a combination of group text chat, email and scheduled weekly meetings.
